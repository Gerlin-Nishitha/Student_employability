# Student_employability
This Student Employability Prediction System uses Machine Learning to assess a student's employability based on soft skills like communication, confidence, and presentation ability. Built with Gradio, it provides an interactive UI where users rate their skills on a scale of 1-5. The system uses Logistic Regression and Perceptron models to predict whether a student is Employable or Not Employable. The project leverages Python, scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy for data processing and model training. Simply enter your ratings, get an instant prediction, and evaluate your job readiness in real-time!
